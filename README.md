KeyBERT is a minimal keyword extraction technique that leverages BERT-based embeddings to create keywords and keyphrases that are most similar to a document. Here's a breakdown of KeyBERT and the process of metadata enrichment:

KeyBERT Overview:

KeyBERT uses BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to create embeddings for words and documents.
It extracts keywords that are semantically similar to the document as a whole.
The algorithm is simple yet effective, making it useful for various NLP tasks.


Basic KeyBERT Process:
a) Embed the document using a BERT model.
b) Embed individual words or n-grams from the document.
c) Use cosine similarity to find words/phrases most similar to the document embedding.
d) Return the top N keywords based on similarity scores.
Metadata Enrichment with KeyBERT:
The process of enriching metadata using KeyBERT typically involves several functions:
a) preprocess_text(text):

Cleans and prepares the text for keyword extraction.
May involve lowercasing, removing punctuation, and tokenization.

b) extract_keywords(text, model, top_n=5):

Uses KeyBERT to extract the top N keywords from the given text.
Parameters include the text, the BERT model to use, and the number of keywords to extract.

c) enrich_metadata(metadata, text_field, keyword_field):

Takes existing metadata and adds extracted keywords to it.
Parameters typically include the original metadata, the field containing the text to analyze, and the field where keywords should be stored.

d) batch_process(data, text_field, keyword_field, batch_size=100):

Processes a large dataset in batches to improve efficiency.
Applies the keyword extraction and metadata enrichment to multiple items at once.

e) update_database(enriched_data):

Updates the database or storage system with the newly enriched metadata.

f) main():

Orchestrates the entire process, calling the above functions in the correct order.
Handles any error logging or reporting.


Benefits of Metadata Enrichment with KeyBERT:

Improves searchability of documents by adding relevant keywords.
Enhances content categorization and organization.
Can be used for content recommendation systems.
Useful for summarization tasks or quick document understanding.


Considerations:

The quality of keywords depends on the BERT model used and the nature of the documents.
Processing time can be significant for large datasets, hence the need for batch processing.
May require fine-tuning or domain-specific models for specialized

Certainly. KeyBERT can be a valuable tool in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for Large Language Models (LLMs). Let's explore how KeyBERT can be applied in the context of RAG:

RAG Overview:
RAG combines retrieval of relevant information from an external knowledge base with the generative capabilities of an LLM. This approach enhances the model's responses with up-to-date and specific information.
Application of KeyBERT in RAG:
a) Document Indexing:

KeyBERT can extract key terms from documents in the knowledge base.
These terms can be used to create more effective document indices.

b) Query Expansion:

When a user query comes in, KeyBERT can extract its key terms.
These terms can be used to expand the query, improving retrieval accuracy.

c) Relevance Ranking:

KeyBERT-extracted keywords from both the query and potential relevant documents can be compared to improve ranking of retrieval results.

d) Document Summarization:

KeyBERT can extract the most important terms from lengthy documents, aiding in quick summarization for the LLM to process


```bash
from keybert import KeyBERT
   from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
   import numpy as np
   from typing import List, Dict

   class KeyBERTRAG:
       def __init__(self, model_name: str = 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'):
           self.kw_model = KeyBERT(model=model_name)
           self.st_model = SentenceTransformer(model_name)
       
       def extract_keywords(self, text: str, top_n: int = 5) -> List[str]:
           keywords = self.kw_model.extract_keywords(text, top_n=top_n, stop_words='english')
           return [kw[0] for kw in keywords]
       
       def index_documents(self, documents: List[Dict[str, str]]) -> List[Dict[str, any]]:
           for doc in documents:
               doc['keywords'] = self.extract_keywords(doc['content'])
               doc['embedding'] = self.st_model.encode(doc['content'])
           return documents
       
       def expand_query(self, query: str) -> str:
           keywords = self.extract_keywords(query, top_n=3)
           return query + ' ' + ' '.join(keywords)
       
       def rank_documents(self, query: str, documents: List[Dict[str, any]]) -> List[Dict[str, any]]:
           query_embedding = self.st_model.encode(query)
           for doc in documents:
               doc['score'] = np.dot(query_embedding, doc['embedding'])
           return sorted(documents, key=lambda x: x['score'], reverse=True)
       
       def retrieve(self, query: str, documents: List[Dict[str, any]], top_k: int = 3) -> List[Dict[str, any]]:
           expanded_query = self.expand_query(query)
           ranked_docs = self.rank_documents(expanded_query, documents)
           return ranked_docs[:top_k]

   # Usage example
   rag = KeyBERTRAG()
   documents = [
       {"id": 1, "content": "Python is a high-level programming language."},
       {"id": 2, "content": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence."},
       # ... more documents ...
   ]
   indexed_docs = rag.index_documents(documents)
   query = "What is Python used for?"
   retrieved_docs = rag.retrieve(query, indexed_docs)
   
   # The retrieved documents can then be passed to an LLM for generation

```
